Changes in build and source code
================================
Replace yui-compressor with `stylus -c`
Replace SASS with stylus
Remove bourbon

Use coffeescript
Use modernizr
Look into using AngularJS

Put source files into subfolders not one top-level folder
Rename folders with proper names
- pkg > build
- tmp > .cache
- thirdparty > lib

Do not minify output. Create minified files additionally, not only
Minify final compiled files not each component file


UI
==
Do not use hover=exclusive interactions, allow dropdown interacting
- Hover interactions break on mobile

Adapt to screen=width
- Look into how bootstrap does it


Reduce complexity of product
============================
Form core JS file to include, and get theme etc settings via JS.
Figure out way to load CSS properly
- May need default theme. symlink to provide defaults


Functionality implementation order
==================================
Focus on getting bar with shortcuts and social buttons/stats first
Then add search
Then consider writing backend for recommendations and ranking of posts

No Ajax magic for pages yet


Social Stats
============
Use YQL, cache returned stats
